## SimTelco

- This is a variation of SimRadio from FluxTune
- It will work similarly
    - the user will "tune" through a simulated "spectrum" and encounter dynamcic audio objects (like the SimRadio "stations")
- The VFO A frequency will start at 5550000.0 and will be displayed like a phone number instead of a frequency, such as 555-0000, increasing as you dial in "1 Hz" increments, as if you are tuning through the available phone number "spectrum"
- Like the simulated stations, there will be similated dynamic audio objects (need help with a simple term like "station" for these objects) encountered while tuning, and relocated by the station manager
    - Simple Examples:
        - US dial tone (350 and 440 Hz)
        - US ring sound as heard in the phone headset (440 and 480 Hz)
        - US busy signal (regular and fast) (480 and 620 Hz)
        - DTMF dialing tones (well known Hz)
    - Complex Example:
        - Complete call sequence with variable ending (akin to a complete QSO station for SimRadio)
